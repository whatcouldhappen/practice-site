    <h1>About Tessara</h1>
    <h2>Turning good intentions into shared progress</h2>

    <p>Tessara exists to close a familiar gap: <strong>people want to help, and organizations need help—but connecting the two is harder than it should be.</strong></p>

    <p>Volunteers often don’t know where they’re most needed, what’s realistic for their schedule, or how to get started without friction. Non-profits, meanwhile, are stretched thin—juggling programs, staffing, and administration while trying to recruit and retain reliable volunteers.</p>

    <p>Tessara is designed to make that connection simpler, clearer, and more human.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Tessara helps match volunteers with local non-profit organizations in ways that respect <strong>time, capacity, and real-world constraints</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear expectations for volunteers</li>
      <li>Practical needs defined by organizations</li>
      <li>Reducing administrative overhead for everyone involved</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn’t about maximizing sign-ups or chasing metrics. It’s about helping work actually get done.</p>

    <hr />

    </ul>

    <h2>Who Tessara Is For</h2>
    <h3>Volunteers</h3>

    <h2>Why Tessara Is Different</h2>
    <p>Many volunteer platforms focus on scale. Tessara focuses on <strong>fit</strong>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Our Name</h2>
    <p>A <em>tessera</em> is a single tile in a mosaic. On its own, it’s small. Together with others, it creates something larger and lasting.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Where We’re Headed</h2>
    <p>Tessara is growing carefully and intentionally. We’re starting locally, learning from real organizations and real volunteers, and building systems that work in practice—not just in theory.</p>
